# Employee Turnover Prediction Project
### Project Overview
This notebook serves as the capstone project for the Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate Program on Coursera. The project focuses on developing a predictive model to determine whether an employee at Salifort Motors is likely to leave the company. The primary objectives include increasing employee retention rates and reducing the costs associated with recruitment, interviews, and training.

### Project Status
The project has been completed, with the implemented models providing insights into employee turnover factors. The predictive model aims to empower the management team with data-driven decision-making capabilities.

### Project Objectives
Employee Retention: Develop a model to predict the likelihood of an employee leaving, enabling proactive retention strategies.
Cost Reduction: Anticipate employee departures to minimize recruitment, interview, and training costs.
Data-Driven Decisions: Provide actionable insights into factors influencing employee turnover for informed decision-making.

### Project Description
Salifort Motors, a fictional French-based alternative energy vehicle manufacturer, employs over 100,000 people globally. The company specializes in electric, solar, algae, and hydrogen-based vehicles, positioning itself as a leader in alternative energy and automobiles.
With high employee attrition rates, Salifort Motors seeks to address this issue due to the associated high costs of recruitment and training. The project utilizes Python and Jupyter Notebooks for data exploration, Pandas and Numpy for operational tasks, and Seaborn and Matplotlib for visualizations. Machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, were implemented to achieve the project objectives.

### Model Selection
The project initially explored Logistic Regression, but the results were not satisfactory. Therefore, Decision Tree and Random Forest models were developed to provide more robust insights into employee turnover.

## Conclusion
The Salifort Project aimed to contribute to Salifort Motors' strategic goals by providing a predictive model to address employee turnover. The implemented models offer valuable insights that can support informed decision-making and contribute to a more stable work environment.
